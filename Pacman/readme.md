## Pacman project

## About
  Pacman was a project I did in the MIT xPro BootCamp. It uses HTML and Javascript to create Pacman that bounce off the walls. The 3 documents Index.html, and pacman.js 
  are linked to create the style and function of this page.
  
## How to Run
  Load the page https://nater14.github.io/Pacman/index.html and then hit the button that says Add Pacman. You can click this as many times as you like. It continues to 
  spawn Pacmans. As soon as you've created as many as you want click start game. This will start all the pacmans moving in random directions. When they hit the edges 
  they bounce back! Pro tip, you can continue to create pacman even after you've hit start game. Also the more you hit start game the quicker the pacman go!
  
 ## Improvement
   Some improvements that will be worked on are: Graphic Mode; This will create a mode that allows blood and gore from the collisions the pacman will get bloodier and 
   bloodier each time they hit the edges. After a certain amount of abuse they will disappear; Shrinking Mode: As the pacman hit the sides they will get smaller and 
   smaller until eventually they disappear.
