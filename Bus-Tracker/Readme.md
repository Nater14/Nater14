## Real Time Bus Tracker

## About
  Real Time Bus Tracker was a project I did in the MIT xPro BootCamp. It uses a Mapbox API, styling with CSS and Javascript for animation to create a map with chosen
  satellite and street styling. It has a marker that shows where the busses are in real time.

## How To Run:  
  After opening https://nater14.github.io/Bus-Tracker/index.html in the browser, click the button that says "Show stops between MIT and Harvard". When you click that 
  button the map marker will move to the Latitude/Longitude of all the known bus stops between MIT and Harvard.

## Future Improvements:   

  Looking into adding additional information provided by the API to be able to give more information about the routes and frequency that busses go to each one.
