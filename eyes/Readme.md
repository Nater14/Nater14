## Eyes project

## About
  Eyes was a project I did in the MIT xPro BootCamp. It uses HTML, Javascript, and CSS to create these eyes that follow your mouse button. The 3 documents Index.html, styles.css and app.js 
  are linked to create the style and function of this page.
  
## How to Run
  Load the page Nater14.github.io/projects/eyes.html and then start being creeped out! As soon as you move your mouse on to the screen the eyes will be fixated on it. Move it as fast as 
  you want you can't hide from them!
  
 ## Improvement
   Some improvements that will be worked on are: Cyclops mode; which will allow just one eye to be on the screen and Ex-Girlfriend Mode; which will change the eyes to constantly avoid your mouse.
