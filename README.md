Are you checking in on my progress as I journey to become a Developer? Right now, I am a student with MIT xPRO.

As you go through my projects you'll see examples of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. These will mostly be from my work at MIT xPro, but as I improve and start working on my own individual projects, those will show up here as well.

If you haven't seen my portfolio yet, go check it out. Nater14.github.io

Keep checking back here for new posted projects!
